## CSRF Filter

# ~~~~~
# Play supports multiple methods for verifying that a request is not a CSRF request.
# The primary mechanism is a CSRF token. This token gets placed either in the query string
# or body of every form submitted, and also gets placed in the users session.
# Play then verifies that both tokens are present and match.
